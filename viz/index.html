    <p class="dek">There's more to NCAA women's basketball than UConn</p>

    <div id="byline">BY KARA NEWHOUSE<br>MAY 3, 2022</div>

    <div class="row">
      <p class="intro1">For most of the 2010s, the University of Connecticut dominated women's college basketball. The Huskies have won 11 NCAA championships — the most of any program  — all with Coach Geno Auriemma at the helm.</p>
      <p class="intro2">When current WNBA superstar Breanna Stewart played for UConn from 2013-2016, the team won four consecutive titles. Back then, it wasn't hard to find someone asking whether UConn’s success was “bad for women’s basketball.” But it's been six years since the team from Storrs has won a national title.</p>
      <p class="intro2">Is UConn on the decline? Have other programs leveled up? Let's explore the state of play in college women's basketball.</p>
      <p>In the four decades since the NCAA women's championships began, 15 schools have won it all at least once. Connecticut and Tennessee emerged as powerhouses starting in the late 1980s and sustaining a heated rivalry into the early 2000s. Their trophy tallies remain unmatched, but four different programs have won the last five titles.</p>
      <p>That includes Stanford, which notched its third title after winning consecutive championships nearly 30 years ago, and Notre Dame, which won its second title in 2018 after a 17-year gap. Despite the title droughts, both teams have been regular features of the tournament's end stage: each has made seven Final Four appearances since 2010.</p>
      <p>South Carolina appeared in fewer Final Fours than those Stanford and Notre Dame, but the Gamecocks nevertheless proved their ability to go all the way, winning the school's first championship in 2017 and its second this past spring.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <p>But trophies aren't the only way to metric of a team's strength. Let's consider another: Her Hoops Stats ratings.</p>
        <p><a href="https://herhoopstats.com/">Her Hoops Stats</a> is a women's basketball website with game data going back to the 2009-10 season in the NCAA. The site has used machine learning to rate teams across those seasons. HHS ratings represent the number of points by which team would be expected to outscore an average opponent on a neutral court.</p>
        <p class="extra-bottom">According to those ratings, University of Connecticut was most often the strongest team among any of the six that won an NCAA championship in that period in the last 13 years. But starting in 2018-19, the gap narrowed, and some teams — Baylor, Notre Dame, South Carolina and Stanford — were rated higher than UConn in certain years.</p>

        <script src="hhs-overall-line.js"></script>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <p class="extra-bottom">If we slice those ratings another way — by isolating the max and min rating for each team — UConn again takes the lead. Its high and low HHS ratings in the last were higher than the comparable ratings for the other five NCAA champions. Stanford and Baylor stand out for a different reason, though. They had the smallest gaps between their max and min ratings, suggesting a more consistent level of competitiveness than other schools.</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <p class="extra-bottom">The competition looks even stronger when we examine Her Hoop Stats' offensive and defensive ratings. The Huskies were rated at or near the top of the group for offense every year, but outside of Breanna Stewart's tenure, the distance between UConn and other top teams was narrow or nonexistent. And on defense, most of the other NCAA champions outranked UConn across seasons.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <p>So has parity been reached in women's college basketball? The answer isn't straightforward. UConn's four consecutive titles from 2013 to 2016 were unprecedented. But Breanna Stewart's undeniable scoring abilities probably had an outsized influence on the gap between the Huskies and the rest of the pack. Since 2016, a mix of teams have won championships, and a look across the last 13 years tells us that most of those teams were consistently strong before and during UConn's win streak. Now UConn is back at their level. Far from declining, though, the team has another rising star in Paige Bueckers. After missing most of her sophomore season to injury, she has two more years to bring her team back to its familiar spot at the top.</p>
