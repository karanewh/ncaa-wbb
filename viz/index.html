    <p class="dek">There's more to NCAA women's basketball than UConn</p>

    <div id="byline">BY KARA NEWHOUSE<br>MAY 3, 2022</div>

    <div class="row">
      <p class="intro1">For most of the 2010s, the University of Connecticut dominated women's college basketball. The Huskies have won 11 NCAA championships — the most of any program  — all with Coach Geno Auriemma at the helm.</p>
      <p class="intro2">When current WNBA superstar Breanna Stewart played for UConn from 2013-2016, the team won four consecutive titles. Back then, it wasn't hard to find someone asking whether UConn’s success was “bad for women’s basketball.” But it's been six years since the team from Storrs has won a national title.</p>
      <p class="intro2">Is UConn on the decline? Have other programs leveled up? Let's explore the state of play in college women's basketball.</p>
      <p>In the four decades since the NCAA women's championships began, 15 schools have won it all at least once. Connecticut and Tennessee emerged as powerhouses starting in the late 1980s and sustaining a heated rivalry into the early 2000s. Their trophy tallies remain unmatched, but four different programs have won the last five titles.</p>
      <p>That includes Stanford, which notched its third title after winning consecutive championships nearly 30 years ago, and Notre Dame, which won its second title in 2018 after a 17-year gap. Despite the title droughts, both teams have been regular features of the tournament's end stage: each has made seven Final Four appearances since 2010.</p>
      <p>South Carolina appeared in fewer Final Fours than those Stanford and Notre Dame, but the Gamecocks nevertheless proved their ability to go all the way, winning the school's first championship in 2017 and its second this past spring.</p>

        <p>For most of the last 13 years, University of Connecticut was the strongest among any of the six teams that won an NCAA championship, according to Her Hoop Stats Ratings. But starting in 2018-19, the gap narrowed, and some teams - Baylor, Notre Dame, South Carolina and Stanford - were rated higher than UConn in certain years. The HHS Rating is a 'predictive metric of team strength based on machine learning.' It represents the number of points by which team would be expected to outscore an average opponent on a neutral court.</p>
